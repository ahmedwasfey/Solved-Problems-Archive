# Solved-Problems-Archive
those are my solutions to **some** problems that I have solved  during last +3 years on different online judges training myself to master different 
algorithms ( DFS , BFS , MST , Dynamic programming , different number theory algorithms ..etc ) and different datastructures ( queue, setes , hash maps , disjoint set union , segment trees...etc )
